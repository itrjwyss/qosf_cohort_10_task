# Task 1 Statevector simulation of quantum circuits

## General task definition

> For this task, you will implement a statevector simulator for quantum circuits from scratch. The goal is to demystify how to simulate a quantum computer and to demonstrate your familiarity with quantum circuits. 

## Subtasks

1. [Naive simulation using matrix multiplication](naive_simulation.md)
2. [Advanced simulation using tensor multiplication](advanced_simulation.md)
3. [Bonus questions](bonus_questions.md)

## General technical aspects

### Used Libraries and Programming Languages

- Python 3.12
- venv (virtual environment, any one will work)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Time

### Quantum Circuit Simulator

This Python script simulates the behavior of quantum circuits using NumPy for numerical computations and Matplotlib for visualization.
